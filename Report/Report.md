## Final Report

# Goals and Motivations

This project is an effort to create a publicly accessible digital archive of Williamstown Police Department records.

We are motivated in part by the recent history of the Williamstown Police Department. The *Williams Record* provides good coverage of some of the recent events that inspired this work. [This](https://williamsrecord.com/352894/news/lawsuit-brought-by-wpd-sergeant-alleges-sexual-assault-racial-harassment-by-williamstown-police-chief-and-unnamed-officers/) is an excellent starting place.

We conducted interviews with students and community members and identified questions that need to be examined. Key questions include examining police activity by time of day, identifying patterns of activity of individual officers, identifying patterns of police activity at the elementary school, and looking for evidence for the broad reasons for ticket-writing. For more information, please contact Chad Topaz.

Next Steps

Some possible next steps may include, but are not limited to:
- cleaning some of the data and verifying its legitimacy (the log number and date are not done, status is mostly done, the dispatcher is mostly done, the location data is done) 
- generating the data in a time series (folium has a cloropleth package feature that may be useful, but other programs may be needed)
- create a dashboard where the public can easily view this data (OIT can likely host the database and the website for users to see)
- try to perform some general statistics on the data (which officers are involved in the most serious logs, where do they occur, are logs distributed evenly or pile up on weekends?)
- Look into potential correlations with the races of police vs those being arrested/cited
- There are a series of questions/notes that we received from DIRE
