Next Steps

Some possible next steps may include, but are not limited to:
- cleaning some of the data and verifying its legitimacy (the log number and date are not done, status is mostly done, the dispatcher is mostly done, the location data is done) 
- generating the data in a time series (folium has a cloropleth package feature that may be useful, but other programs may be needed)
- create a dashboard where the public can easily view this data (OIT can likely host the database and the website for users to see)
- try to perform some general statistics on the data (which officers are involved in the most serious logs, where do they occur, are logs distributed evenly or pile up on weekends?)
- Look into potential correlations with the races of police vs those being arrested/cited
- There are a series of questions/notes that we received from DIRE
