:           Mike didn't actually have the butter knife in his hand or
cut himself. He left because he was upset with another
:           resident. Mike was located behind Williamstown Physical
           Therapy building. He was calm and stated he didn't want to
hurt himself or anyone else. He only wished to go back to
Turning Point take a shower, get his meds and go to bed.
           Staff was advised and were fine with him returning.

            oxygen at the residence and the party was looking for
            automatic well being checks every time there is a power
            outage in the area. He was advised that we cannot set
            something like that up, but will respond when this occurs if
            we get a call during an outage. Party advised that there was
            no cell coverage in the area, and that the phone doesn't
            work without power. Dispatch explained that a basic corded

. Narrative:
            Female party very upset. Believe to be very intoxicated.
            Could not get a straight answer on her needs. She was asked                       2
            multiple times. CP just kept crying. CP eventually just put
            the phone down and continued to cry. CP would not come back
:            to her phone on many requests. I stayed on the phone until
            officers arrived.

             with Kevin (Manager of Pizza Works) who stated the RP was
extremely rude not only on the phone with him but also with
             the driver. He stated the residents at 35 Pines lodge were
:             making derogatory statements to himself and the driver. He

             charged and a new pizza was offered to be delivered which
             they refused.

pull the dog into the house by the fur on the back of its
neck. I looked at the dog and it didn't have any visible
signs of abuse. The owner was advised of the cruelty to

           Driveway icy
Wife calling to report that her husband received numerous
phone calls two days ago that is most likely a scam and they
are looking for advice on how to proceed. Because of how
             convincing they were he did get scared into giving them his
             Social Security Number and home address. He did hang up at
            one point after being on the phone for a long time. Then he
             said he got a call back and they said they were from the
Williamstown Police department. He didn't think that was
true because of the accent that they had. There maybe have
            then been 16 or so calls that he didn't answer because he
            was teaching.
RP provided information for ID Theft from Mass.Gov and the
IRS.
            Any advice or places to point us would be great.

' Narrative:
            Ofc. Jennings contacted Beth Westcott while I was enroute.
            Westcott stated she could see her son and three friends
            playing football on Mill Street. I met with Westcott and the
;            four juveniles who admitted they were by the mill and were
            curious to see what it looked like inside; however, they
            were unable to enter the property. All youths advised of the
dangers the property presents and to refrain from trying to
enter again. All children were extremely cooperative and
            agreed to not enter again.

            Party was notified that contact was made and phone reset,
            states a family member will be stopping to check in on her
tomorrow morning.
. Narrative:
I spoke with Mrs. Arick, and forwarded the message. Mrs.
Arick appeared clean and nourished. The house appeared in
order from looking in the windows. However, Mrs. Arick did
show signs of dementia and indicated she was not sure she
            knew how to use a phone to call her husband. I could see the
            phone was off the hook from looking through the glass front
:            door. I contacted dispatch to advise the husband of my
            findings, and to find out if there was someone who could
look after / check-in on Mrs. Arick. Prior to clearing,I
            checked on Mrs. Arick one more time, she was on the phone
            and speaking with her husband.

.            reporting the activation. Rich also stated he heard the
            telephone ring, but did not answer as he was in the process
:            of opening for the day. Rich advised to calli the WPD or
;            alarm company in the future to cancel our response as the
            alarm company will report the incident when their call goes
           unanswered.                                          .

' Narrative:
            CP looking to speak to Ofc Sacco about some missing plants.
- Narrative:
            Attempted call back. No voicemail set up.
            Sacco spoke with Dave Wiles who stated that the flowers were
:            an un-maintained flower bed that the Housing Authority
            allows, but if unkempt, they remove same. Wiles stated that
;            it was 5-6 weeks after she moved to her new apartment that
            his crew began dismantling the flower bed as technically, it
;            was not. supposed to be there. Several residents approached
:            him asking if they could have the plants as he was
            discarding same. Wiles agreed and allowed them to take the
            plants. Wiles stated that 1-2 weeks after the removal of the
.            plants, she became angry about the situation. Not a police
            Matter, this should be taken up with the Housing Authority.
Narrative:
           Spoke with Grace who stated management sent her an email
            agreeing to help move her flowers to her new apartment. Her
           plants are all gone now and believed to be at different
           apartments throughout the property. Grace stated that David
:           from maintenance gave residence permission to take what they
.           wanted. She claims management has done nothing to protect
           her or her property. I will attempt to make contact with
           David on monday to get his side of the story.

Narrative:
           Spoke to Mike and he agreed to be quieter on the phone
.           speaking to his dad. Mike was upset with Bill the night

_ Narrative:
            On June 6, 2020, Turning Point employee Kim Kennedy, called
            to report after the police response, Mr. Nawazelski, sprayed
            Mr. Allard, with a hose and put soap on him, which
            ultimately entered Mr. Allard's eyes. Ms. Kennedy states Mr.
            Nawazelski has a history of abuse and regularly harasses Mr.
:            Allard, and she would like court action. I advised Ms.
            Kennedy why the WPD would not seek a criminal complaint and                       |
            provided her with suggestions on how to handle the matter                         |
            internally. I also advised MS. Kennedy I would document her                       ,
            report, and she was pleased with the police assistance                            |
.            today. (The call with Ms. Kennedy was placed from a                               |

- Narrative:
:             I spoke with Lafleur via telephone, who reported Turning
Point employee, Angela Guzzi, is refusing to give him his
             pain medication, because he will not turn over his car keys
             to her. Lafleur states that Guzzi is upset because he
admitted to her that he drove his vehicle from his home to
the mailboxes in Pines Lodge. Lafleur was advised of his
            options and decided, at this time, to not pursue the matter
until he can speak with a Brien Center supervisor tomorrow.
            While speaking with Lefleur, he was calm and cooperative and
indicated he has no suicidal ideations. Lefleur was also
advised not to drive a motor vehicle.
